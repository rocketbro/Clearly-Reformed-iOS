## About Clearly Reformed
In an age of confusion and complication, we believe one of the great needs in our day is for clarity. People need Bible truths and good theology presented clearly and applied carefully—to their lives and to the problems of our day.

Under this Clearly Reformed umbrella, we have a number of ministry initiatives and resources.

### Website and Resources
ClearlyReformed.org has over 3,000 pieces of Kevin DeYoung’s content produced over the years—sermons, articles, columns, interviews, and conference messages. Our goal is that this content helps each person to deepen their understanding of who God is and further develop their walk with the Lord.

### Podcasts
On Life, and Books, and Everything Kevin interviews authors, ministry leaders, and other guests. Sometimes he talks to friends about what’s happening in the world.

On the Clearly Reformed Podcast Kevin reads from a collection of original articles from Clearly Reformed.

### Explainer Video Series
You may have seen the first video we released last year on divine simplicity. We have more videos like that pilot episode in the works. As we have funding, we would love to see dozens of videos explaining important theological topics in a short, professional, attractive format.

### Coram Deo Pastors Conference
Clearly Reformed and Christ Covenant Church are hosting the inaugural Coram Deo Pastors Conference in March 2024. The aim of the conference is simple: to strengthen pastors. We look forward to filling the sanctuary with close to 2,000 pastors March 12-14, 2024 at Christ Covenant Church in Matthews, North Carolina. Registration information and other details can be found here.

Clearly Reformed is a brand-new ministry. We are grateful for your interest in what we are all about. Our hope is that we might be able to serve the cause of Christ in the world, and Clearly Reformed might be a blessing to you and your church.
